## [/WeatherPy](WeatherPy)
Houses code that performs an analysis and visualizes changes in weather based on an area's latitudinal distance from the equator.
### [WeatherPy](WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb)
Code that performs an analysis and visualizes changes in weather based on an area's latitudinal distance from the equator.
### [/Charts](WeatherPy/Charts)
Charts created by the code in WeatherPy for quick reference rather than having to dig through code. Regression lines are shown for charts depicting weather changes by latitude by hemisphere.
* Charts for the Entire Globe
  * [Temperature by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/temp_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the maximum temperature in farenheit at a city's given latitude.
  * [Humidity by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/humid_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent humidity at a city's given latitude.
  * [Cloudiness by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/cloud_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent cloudiness at a city's given latitude.
  * [Wind Speed by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/wind_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the wind speed in miles per hour at a city's given latitude.
* Charts for the Northern Hemisphere
  * [Temperature by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/northern_temp_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the maximum temperature in farenheit at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or greater.
  * [Humidity by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/northern_humid_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent humidity at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or greater.
  * [Wind Speed by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/northern_wind_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the wind speed in miles per hour at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or greater.
  * [Cloudiness by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/northern_cloud_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent cloudiness at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or greater.
* Charts for the Southern Hemisphere
  * [Temperature by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/southern_temp_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the maximum temperature in farenheit at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or less.
  * [Humidity by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/southern_humid_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent humidity at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or less.
  * [Wind Speed by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/southern_wind_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the wind speed in miles per hour at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or less.
  * [Cloudiness by Latitude](WeatherPy/Charts/southern_cloud_by_lat.png)
  Scatterplot showing the the percent cloudiness at a city's given latitude, for cities whose latitude is zero (the equator) or less.
